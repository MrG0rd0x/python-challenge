PyPoll

This code analyzes a csv file with polling data from voters and returns the following:

- total number of votes cast

- the percentage of votes each candidate won

- the total number of votes each candidate won

- the winner of the election based on popular vote

Code uses a dictionary, created with candidate names, which adds a count to the key 
every time the row shows that candidate

Percentages and winner are calculated in the print lines, by going through a for loop created from a list of candidate names.
