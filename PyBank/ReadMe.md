PyBank 

This Python script will analyze the financial records of the company.
It is designed to be run on a csv file with the following information:
- month/year
- profit/losses

It will analyze the records to caluculate the following:
- total number of months included in the dataset
- net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- the average of those changes
- the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

These results will be printed in the terminal and duplicated in a file named "analysis".
